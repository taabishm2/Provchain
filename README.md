## Description:

Provchain establishes a provenance knowledge framework and uses it to enhance assurances and reduce perceived risks in product supplychains. The goal of Provchain is to implement a decentralized supply chain tracking platform which ensures end-to-end product tracing. This is done while incurring minimum costs of implementation as well causing no disruptions to the supply chains in which it is integrated.  


## Getting Started
