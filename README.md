## Description:

Provchain establishes a provenance knowledge framework and uses it to enhance assurances and reduce perceived risks in product supplychains. The goal of Provchain is to implement a decentralized supply chain tracking platform which ensures end-to-end product tracing. This is done while incurring minimum costs of implementation as well causing no disruptions to the supply chains in which it is integrated.

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

Tools:

1. Ganache
2. Metamask


### QuickStart

Open Ganache desktop application and import the test accounts for each participant to Metamask. 
Compile and migrate the contracts to the local Ethereum network in Ganache by using
```
truffle compile
truffle migrate --reset
```
The website will run, by default, on localhost:3000
